Here are some insights that can be obtained from the Kimia Farma performance analysis dashboard for the years 2020-2023.
1. The total number of transactions conducted by all Kimia Farma branches in Indonesia from 2020 to 2023 reached 672,458 transactions, resulting in a total profit of 98.5 billion rupiahs, with total sales amounting to 347 billion products sold.
2. The overall branch rating reached 4.4/5, indicating that Kimia Farma has a fairly good performance in terms of profit and sales. This is further supported by the previous point.
3. The pie chart shows the percentage distribution of revenue from year to year, with each year’s figure remaining stable at around 25%. This indicates that the company’s growth has been fairly consistent without significant fluctuations.
4. West Java is the province with the highest total transactions, reaching nearly 200,000 transactions, with total sales amounting to 102 billion products sold. This also contributes to the highest profit of 29 billion rupiahs, as indicated by the geo chart, where the darkest-colored region represents the highest profit.This performance could be a priority in business strategy.
5. The pie chart in the image shows the total sales of products across various categories. One of them is psycholeptic drugs, hypnotics, and sedatives, which contribute 134,849 units (20.1%) of the total sales. This category has the largest proportion compared to other categories in the chart. This reflects the high demand for medications related to mental health, relaxation, or the treatment of sleep disorders.
6. The highest branch rating was achieved by a branch in South Sumatra, with a score of 4.8/5. However, it has a lower transaction rating of 4.1/5. Similarly, some other branches have high ratings but a low number of transactions, which could be a focus for further evaluation.
